There are no special instructions needed to run my application, the backend is hosted by Supabase so you do not need to run any servers, just open the application,
create a profile and log in. Note, I have used Expo Application Services (EAS) to share the application as I use a .env file for my Supabase api key and I didn't want to 
expose this on Expo Snack. I will try to keep this updated as various expo versions get released, but the source code will remain as submitted. Lastly, this application 
is tested on Android and iOS, but will not run on the web browser as React Native Maps does not work on the browser. As this it the Mobile Development module I left this 
as is, but were I to also want to publish on the web I would use other map modules for web users. Thank you.
